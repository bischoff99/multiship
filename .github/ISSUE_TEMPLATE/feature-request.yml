      description: |
        Describe in detail how this feature would be used and who would benefit from it. Include any specific workflows or user journeys.
      placeholder: |
        When a user needs to create multiple shipments at once, they currently have to make individual API calls for each provider. This feature would allow them to submit a single request with multiple shipments and receive consolidated results.

      description: |
        If you have thoughts on how this feature should be implemented, please share them. Consider the project's architecture patterns and provider integrations.
      placeholder: |
        This could be implemented by:
        1. Creating a new BulkShipmentService that coordinates with multiple provider adapters
        2. Adding a circuit breaker to handle partial failures gracefully
        3. Implementing request deduplication using Redis cache
        4. Adding monitoring for bulk operation performance

      label: Alternative Solutions
      description: |
        Have you considered any alternative approaches or workarounds? What are the pros/cons of your proposed solution vs alternatives?
      placeholder: |
        **Alternative 1:** Continue with individual API calls
        - Pros: Simpler implementation, existing patterns
        - Cons: Higher latency, more complex client-side handling

        **Alternative 2:** Batch processing with queue system
        - Pros: Better for very large batches, async processing
        - Cons: More complex architecture, delayed responses
