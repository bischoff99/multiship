### Rate Shopping
The platform automatically compares rates across all connected providers to find:
- Lowest shipping costs

## üí° Best Practices

### Address Management
```javascript
// Always validate addresses before shipping
const validatedAddress = await multiship.validateAddress({
  street1: "123 main st",
  city: "anytown",
  state: "ca",
  zip: "12345"
});

// Use the validated/corrected address
const shipment = await multiship.createShipment({
  toAddress: validatedAddress,
  // ... other details
});
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
try {
  const shipment = await multiship.createShipment(orderData);
  console.log('Shipment created:', shipment.id);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED') {
    // Wait and retry
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
    // Retry the request
  } else if (error.code === 'INVALID_ADDRESS') {
    // Show address correction suggestions to user
    console.log('Address suggestions:', error.suggestions);
  } else {
    // Handle other errors
    console.error('Unexpected error:', error.message);
  }
}
```

### Webhook Setup
```javascript
// Set up webhooks for real-time updates
const webhook = await multiship.createWebhook({
  url: 'https://your-app.com/webhooks/multiship',
  events: [
    'shipment.created',
    'shipment.in_transit',
    'shipment.delivered',
    'shipment.exception'
  ]
});

// Handle webhook events
app.post('/webhooks/multiship', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  switch (event.type) {
    case 'shipment.delivered':
      await fulfillOrder(event.data.orderId);
      break;
    case 'shipment.exception':
      await handleShippingException(event.data);
      break;
  }

  res.json({ received: true });
});
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Batch Operations
```javascript
// Create multiple shipments at once
const orders = [/* array of orders */];
const shipments = await multiship.createBatchShipment(orders);

// Track multiple shipments
const trackingInfo = await multiship.batchTrack(shipmentIds);
```

### Analytics and Reporting
```javascript
// Get shipping analytics

  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-01-31',

const costAnalysis = await multiship.getCostAnalysis({
  period: 'monthly',
  compareWithPrevious: true
});
```

await multiship.createRule({
  name: 'Free shipping over $100',
  condition: {
    orderValue: { min: 100 }
  },
  action: {
    type: 'free_shipping',
    provider: 'standard'
  }
});
