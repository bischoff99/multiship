## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment

**Detection Methods:**
- Automated monitoring alerts
- User reports
- Security tool notifications
- Log analysis
- External reports

**Initial Assessment Steps:**
1. **Verify the incident** - Confirm legitimacy of alert
2. **Gather initial information** - Scope, impact, entry point
3. **Classify severity** - Assign appropriate level
4. **Notify core team** - Alert incident coordinator
5. **Document timeline** - Start incident log

**Assessment Checklist:**
- [ ] What systems are affected?
- [ ] What data may be compromised?
- [ ] How did the breach occur?
- [ ] Is the breach ongoing?
- [ ] Who needs to be notified?

### Phase 2: Containment

**Short-term Containment:**
- Isolate affected systems
- Disable compromised accounts
- Block malicious IP addresses
- Stop suspicious processes
- Preserve evidence

**Communication During Containment:**
- Notify internal stakeholders
- Prepare external communications
- Update status page
- Contact law enforcement (if required)

### Phase 3: Eradication

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Identify attack vectors
- Analyze system logs
- Review configuration changes
- Examine user activities
- Document findings

**Remediation Steps:**
- Apply security patches
- Update configurations
- Rotate compromised credentials
- Remove malicious code
- Validate fixes

### Phase 4: Recovery

**System Restoration:**
- Test systems thoroughly
- Restore from clean backups
- Monitor for anomalies
- Gradual service restoration
- Validate normal operations

**Service Restoration Checklist:**
- [ ] All patches applied
- [ ] Credentials rotated
- [ ] Monitoring active
- [ ] Backups verified
- [ ] Performance validated

### Phase 5: Lessons Learned

**Post-Incident Review:**
- Document incident timeline
- Identify what went well
- Identify improvement areas
- Update procedures
- Share learnings
